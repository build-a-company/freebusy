// Package rfc is freebusy's client onto the RFC schema services.
//
// The catalogue freebusy books against is not freebusy's. A bookable thing is an
// RFC 9073 VRESOURCE and the calendar it is booked on is an RFC 5545 VCALENDAR,
// both served by protobuf-rfc's own services. freebusy references them by name —
// AIP-215 says to refer to a resource by name rather than embed it — and reads
// them through here when it needs a fact about one.
//
// Everything in this package is optional. A nil *Client is valid and every
// method on it returns "not found", because the engine has to keep working when
// the catalogue is unreachable: refusing a booking is a better failure than
// crashing, and the caller already has conservative defaults for the facts this
// supplies.
